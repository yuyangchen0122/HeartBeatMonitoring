# Health-Monitor

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

It is a well known fact that a healthy lifestyle depends on three main factors - diet, sleep and exercise. While diet may be dependent on additional factors like income and availability of different produce, sleep and exercise can and should be controllable. Yet, this is not the case due to the fast paced lives people lead and factors like stress, fatigue and lack of motivation act as barriers. The main problems can be listed as:

People only have a limited amount of time on their hands to exercise.
People do not have enough resources to get maximum efficiency from each workout session.
People are unable to have uninterrupted deep sleep due to stress or unhealthy lifestyle.
People do not have the required resources to improve their sleep cycle.
People lack motivation to keep up a healthy workout and sleep schedule.
People do not have enough incentives to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle. 

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

Our proposed solution is an integration between existing devices in the market like fitbits which monitor heart rate, steps etc and a mobile application to record and visualise user data and give them information on how to improve their lifestyle. Also, the proposed application would use music to regulate heartbeat to provide better workout and sleep cycles and implement machine learning to let the app be unique to each user.
